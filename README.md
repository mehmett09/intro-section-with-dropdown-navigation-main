# Intro Section with Dropdown Navigation

## Welcome

This is my solution to the **Intro Section with Dropdown Navigation** challenge on Frontend Mentor. It’s a responsive UI project focused on dropdown menus, hamburger navigation, and interactive UI behavior using DOM events.

---

## The Challenge

Your task was to build a dropdown navigation that works both on desktop and mobile:

- On desktop: dropdown menus that open on click and close when clicking outside.
- On mobile: a hamburger menu that opens a sidebar menu, including nested dropdowns.
- Overlay click should close the mobile menu.
- Responsive across common screen sizes (e.g., mobile and desktop layouts).

## Built With

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS (Flexbox & Media Queries)
- Vanilla JavaScript

---

## Features

- **Desktop dropdowns** – click to toggle, click outside to close  
- **Mobile hamburger menu** with nested dropdowns and overlay  
- **Responsive design** – seamless experience across screen sizes

---

## What I Learned

- Handling dropdown logic with `querySelector`, `classList.toggle`, and event listeners  
- Detecting clicks outside an element to close it (`document.addEventListener`)  
- Overlay behavior to enhance mobile navigation UX  
- Structuring clean, modular JavaScript for UI interactions
